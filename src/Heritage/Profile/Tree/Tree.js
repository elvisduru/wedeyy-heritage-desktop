      <p>
        Born in a small Oklahoma farm on August 12, 1923, John Doyle began his
        journey through life. John was the youngest son of farmer Kenneth Doyle
        and his wife Mary Doyle. Kenneth, a hard working man, raised his four
        children in a very disciplined way. It was from here that John learned
        much of his punctuality. <br />
        John, after leaving home at age 18, decided to move to a city. He went
        to Chicago and became a reporter for several years. He enjoyed his job,
        but yearned to get a college education. He enrolled at the University of
        Chicago. From there he quickly realized that he loved Health Care and
        Biology. Soon he made his decision that he was going to study to become
        a biologist. <br />
        Years after he graduated, I, his wife Darlene, asked why he felt so akin
        to his biological work. He always responded "that this is something I
        enjoy doing and when I feel I am making progress, I realize how
        beneficial my work is." As you can see, John was a very hard working
        man. He ended up finishing his work and retiring at the age of 58. After
        a brief heart attack, John realized he could no longer work as hard a he
        had done in his younger years. On May 2, 1999 John passed away.
